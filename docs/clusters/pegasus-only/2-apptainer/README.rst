Introduction to Singularity/Apptainer on Pegasus
=================================================

**Apptainer**, formerly known as Singularity, is a container platform designed for 
high-performance computing (HPC). It enables the creation and execution of containers 
that package software in a portable and reproducible way. You can build a container 
on your laptop and run it on various platformsâ€”HPC clusters, university or company servers, 
workstations, or the cloud. Containers are bundled into a single .sif file, 
minimizing configuration overhead and simplifying software deployment.

We have implemented and documented several applications using Apptainer.


**Singularity vs. Docker**

While Docker is a widely used container runtime, HPC clusters commonly use Singularity (Apptainer). 
Here's a quick comparison:

**Why use Apptainer**

Apptainer was created to run complex applications on HPC clusters in a
simple, portable, and reproducible way. Many container platforms are
available, but Apptainer is focused on:

     * Verifiable reproducibility and security, using cryptographic signatures,an immutable container image format, and in-memory decryption.

     * Integration over isolation by default. Easily make use of GPUs, high speed networks, parallel file systems on a cluster or server by default.

     * Mobility of compute. The single file SIF container format is easy to transport and share.

     * A simple, effective security model. You are the same user inside a container as outside, and cannot gain additional privilege on the host system by default. Read more about Security in
