Introduction to Linux
--------------------------------

Linux is a UNIX-like operating system, composed of three fundamental components:

- Kernel : Manages hardware resources and handles process execution, memory, device drivers, and system calls.
- Shell : A command-line interface that interprets user input and communicates with the kernel.
- System Programs : Provide essential functionalities such as user environments, file and process management, networking tools, and scheduling services.

In Linux, everything is treated as either a file or a process:

- A file is any collection of data, including directories, device nodes, and configuration files.
- A process is an executing instance of a program.

Directories themselves are implemented as a special type of file that contains mappings of filenames to index node references.
