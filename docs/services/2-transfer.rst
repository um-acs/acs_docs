Transferring Files
==================

IDSC systems support multiple file transfer programs such as FileZilla and
PSFTP, and common command line utilities such as ``scp`` and ``rsync``.
Use cluster head nodes (login nodes) for these types of file transfers.
For transferring large amounts of data from systems outside the
University of Miami, IDSC ACS also offers a gateway server that supports
SFTP and Globus.

Using command line utilities
----------------------------

Use ``cp`` to copy files within the same computation system. Use
``scp``, ``sftp``, or ``rsync`` to transfer files between computational
systems (e.g., scratch space to Visx project space). When executing
multiple instantiations of command line utilities like rsync and scp,
please ***limit your transfers to no more than 2-3 processes at a
time.***

scp
~~~

An example transfer might look like this:

::

    [localmachine: ~]$ scp /local/filename \
                username@pegasus2.ccs.miami.edu:/scratch/projects/projectID/directory

To transfer a directory, use the ``-r`` flag (recursive):

::

    [localmachine: ~]$ scp -r /local/directory \
                username@pegasus2.ccs.miami.edu:/scratch/projects/projectID/directory

Consult the Linux man pages for more information on scp.

rsync
~~~~~

The rsync command is another way to keep data current. In contrast to
scp, rsync transfers only the changed parts of a file (instead of
transferring the entire file). Hence, this selective method of data
transfer can be much more efficient than scp. The following example
demonstrates usage of the rsync command for transferring a file named
"firstExample.c" from the current location to a location on Pegasus.

::

    [localmachine: ~]$ rsync firstExample.c \
                username@pegasus2.ccs.miami.edu:/scratch/projects/projectID/directory

An entire directory can be transferred from source to destination by
using rsync. For directory transfers, the options ``-atvr`` will
transfer the files recursively (``-r`` option) along with the
modification times (``-t`` option) and in the archive mode (``-a``
option). Consult the Linux man pages for more information on rsync.

rclone 
~~~~~~

The rclone a command-line program that can be used to manage your file over SFTP. Rclone supports over 40 cloud storage backends, as well as standard transfer protocols like SFTP.  This is a use case using rclone to migrate data from legacy storage to **IDSC CES** on **apex.idsc.miami.edu** using the latest version of rclone on Pegasus, **rclone v1.63.1**. 


**Load the rclone software module**

::

    [nra20@pegasus ~]$ module load rclone

     When set forces the usage of the ssh-agent.
     When key-file is also set, the ".pub" file of the specified key-file is read and only the associated key is
     requested from the ssh-agent. This allows to avoid `Too many authentication failures for *username*` errors
     when the ssh-agent contains many keys.

**Transfer your data to remote site**

The rclone lsd command will list the folders of the current specified path in the remote system
::

     [nra20@pegasus ~]$ rclone lsd apex:/
               -1 2023-08-09 10:36:35        -1 acs
               -1 2022-11-04 15:20:10        -1 bin
               -1 2022-11-28 15:36:50        -1 dcrawford
               -1 2022-11-04 15:19:15        -1 lib64
               -1 2022-09-30 18:17:33        -1 netra
               -1 2022-09-13 18:12:26        -1 schurerlab
               -1 2023-08-08 17:35:21        -1 selipot

You can create a subdirectory if needed using the rclone mkdir command
::

    [nra20@pegasus ~]$ rclone mkdir apex:/acs/nra20
    [nra20@pegasus ~]$ rclone lsd apex:/acs
          -1 2022-06-08 12:40:43        -1 mihg-mapping
          -1 2023-08-09 10:39:04        -1 nra20
          -1 2022-11-04 15:23:17        -1 pdavila
     
    

**Note:** Because ``rclone copy`` command can take hours to complete, we recommend you use the ``screen`` command when running rclone interactively.  This way the sync will not terminate prematurally, should your ssh session end.

::
    
    [pdavila@pegasus ~]$ screen
    [pdavila@pegasus ~]$ rclone copy /projects/ccs/schurerlab/cheminfo/pdavila apex:/schurerlab/pdavila
    [pdavila@pegasus ~]$ rclone lsd apex:/schurerlab/pdavila/apps/
      -1 2022-06-23 10:36:21        -1 bin
      -1 2022-06-23 10:36:21        -1 ffmpeg
      -1 2022-06-23 10:36:21        -1 firefox
      -1 2022-06-23 10:36:21        -1 wget

You can exit your screen session using the 'exit' command. 


Using FileZilla
---------------

FileZilla is a free, user friendly, open source, cross-platform FTP,
SFTP and FTPS application.

Download the FileZilla client here:
https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?show_all=1 and follow the
installation instructions for the appropriate platform
(http://wiki.filezilla-project.org/Client_Installation).

Launch FileZilla and open **File : Site Manager**.

Click the "New Site" button and name the entry.  Pegasus example::

    Host:       pegasus2.ccs.miami.edu | t2.idsc.miami.edu | apex.idsc.miami.edu (CES)
    Protocol:   SFTP
    Logon Type: Normal
    enter your username and password

Selecting Logon Type: **Ask for password** will prompt for a password
each connection.

Pegasus, Triton & Apex use your IDSC account for authentication.

Click the "Connect" button. Once connected, drag and drop files or
directories between your local machine and the server.

Using VS Code
-------------

Once logged in through VS Code, you can **upload and download files** as follows:

- To **download**, right-click a file or folder and select **Download** from the context menu.
- To **upload**, simply drag and drop files from your local machine into the VS Code interface connected to the remote server.
