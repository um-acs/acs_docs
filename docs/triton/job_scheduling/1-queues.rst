Job Queues on Triton
====================

Queues on Triton are organized using limits like job size, job length, job
purpose, and project. Current or recent resource usage lowers the priority
applied when LSF assigns resources for new jobs from a userâ€™s account.

The **bigmem** queue is available for jobs requiring nodes with expanded
memory. Submitting jobs to this queue requires project membership. Do
not submit jobs that can run on the other queues to the
bigmem queue
