Introduction to Linux
---------------------

Pegasus and Triton both run the CentOS 7.6 and RHEL 7.6 operating systems, 
respectively. Both of these operating systems are distributions of Linux,
a UNIX-like operating system. The three basic components of UNIX-like 
operating systems are the **kernel**, **shell**, and **system programs**. 
The kernel handles resource management and program execution. The shell 
interprets user commands typed at a prompt. System programs implement most 
operating system functionalities such as user environments and schedulers.

Everything in Linux is either a **file** (a collection of data) or a
**process** (an executing program). Directories in Linux are types of
files.

In the examples below, ``username`` represents your access account.
