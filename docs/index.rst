==================
User Documentation
==================

The following documentation is intended to familiarize users with
the computing resources managed by the Advanced Computing Services
team. These consist of two clusters, `Pegasus <https://idsc.miami.edu/pegasus/>`__
and `Triton <https://idsc.miami.edu/triton/>`__, launched in 
2013 and 2019, respectively.

Getting Started
===============

Access to storage and compute resources on Pegasus and Triton can be 
obtained through grant programs administered by the IDSC, or through
project funding managed by research groups. 

Requesting access to cluster computer resources
-----------------------------------------------

Prospective users can access the storage and computer resources by 
requesting the following:

- a project, by filling out `this form <https://redcap.miami.edu/surveys/?s=F8MK9NMW9N>`__.
- an IDSC account, by filling out `this form <https://redcap.miami.edu/surveys/?s=LWNTAWTTJ4>`__.

Connecting to cluster computer resources
----------------------------------------

From on-campus using UM's networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When connected to any of UM's wired or wireless networks, access to the 
cluster computing resources is as outlined 
`here <https://acs-docs.readthedocs.io/services/1-access.html#x11>`__.

From off-campus or when connected to other networks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 

When off-campus or when connected to other networks, access to
UM's Virtual Private Network (VPN) is needed. In order to get access
to UM's VPN, start 
`here <https://www.it.miami.edu/a-z-listing/virtual-private-network/index.html>`__.

.. note :: IDSC does not administer UM VPN accounts.  Support for VPN is handled by UMIT for any and all VPN issues:

When connected to the VPN, cluster resources can be accessed by following 
the same instructions as those for on-campus access with UM's networks.
